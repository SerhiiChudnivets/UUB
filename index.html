                    Another key thread to this strategy is maintaining a high level of expertise. “We have a team that has dealt in the production of legal cannabis for many years, and we’ve also created proprietary software and standard operating procedures, as well as other techniques, that have proven to be quite effective in numerous facilities across many different operating environments,” Gautam explained to World Finance.
                    
                    Given the lack of significant cannabis management expertise in the industry, having an experienced team really sets MJardin apart from others in the space. There are states in the US, for instance, that have only been growing cannabis within a legal framework for less than five years. “MJardin has a head start, so to speak, because our senior operations team has been operating within a legal cannabis framework for a lot longer than five years, so they’re very familiar operating within a regulated environment,” Gautam explained.
                    
                    As senior operators at MJardin have worked in the regulated environment for numerous years, they know exactly how to follow protocol and how to pass testing requirements. “This is crucial, because growing this plant in a very large-scale facility is not easy,” Gautam noted. “There’s always considerations to be made about the environment, the structure of the facility, plant health and so on, so we’ve created a solid system through training, software and standard operating procedures to minimise the risk of facility operations as much as humanly possible – that has been our goal since day one.”</p>

                    The windfall from President Donald Trump's tax-cut helped push dividend payments by companies to a new record, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tuesday.
                    
                    First quarter dividend payments for the S&P 500 hit a high of $12.79 per share, one cent above the previous record set in the fourth quarter of last year.
                    
                    "There were no dividend cuts in the S&P 500 for Q1 2018, an event not seen in my history (which started in 2003)," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.
                    
                    "Given the record cash levels, repatriation and expected record earnings helped by lower tax rates, 2018 could post its seventh consecutive year of record payments," Silverblatt said in a statement. "There is potential for a return to double-digit gains, last seen during 2015."</p>
                    <a > <h2 id="exampleHeadContentItem2">A China-US trade war could hurt the IPO market for a time: EY</h2>
                    </a>
                     <p id="exampleContentItemFirst2">A potential trade war between the world's top two economies may affect the initial public offering market in the short term, a managing partner of a top accounting firm told CNBC on Wednesday.
                             
                             "I think it all depends on the sectors and how long it will affect [them]," Ringo Choi, the Asia Pacific IPO Leader of ErnstnYoung said.
                             
                             "For the short term, I think it will affect the market and that will consequently affect the IPO," Choi said, adding that Chinese listings that are export-oriented, particularly to the U.S., will surely be affected.
                             
                             Chinese companies that are considering options to enter the U.S. market will also face difficulties if the relationship between the two governments shifts from a "partnership basis" to one of a potential trade war.
                             
                             In the long run, however, there will be more dialogue between the two countries according to Choi, who told CNBC he believes both governments are currently gathering more "chips" to bargain with each other in future.
                             
                             "I believe that in the long run, both countries will sit down and talk," he said, adding that the IPO market would therefore not be affected in the long run as a result.</p>
